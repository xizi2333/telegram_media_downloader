## Configuration

All the configurations are  passed to the Telegram Media Downloader via `config.yaml` file.

**Getting your API Keys:**
The very first step requires you to obtain a valid Telegram API key (API id/hash pair):

1. Visit  [https://my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps)  and log in with your Telegram Account.
2. Fill out the form to register a new Telegram application.
3. Done! The API key consists of two parts:  **api_id**  and  **api_hash**.

**Getting chat id:**

**1. Using web telegram:**

1. Open <https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im>

2. Now go to the chat/channel and you will see the URL as something like
   - `https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im?p=u853521067_2449618633394` here `853521067` is the chat id.
   - `https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im?p=@somename` here `somename` is the chat id.
   - `https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im?p=s1301254321_6925449697188775560` here take `1301254321` and add `-100` to the start of the id => `-1001301254321`.
   - `https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im?p=c1301254321_6925449697188775560` here take `1301254321` and add `-100` to the start of the id => `-1001301254321`.

**2. Using bot:**

1. Use [@username_to_id_bot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot) to get the chat_id of
    - almost any telegram user: send username to the bot or just forward their message to the bot
    - any chat: send chat username or copy and send its joinchat link to the bot
    - public or private channel: same as chats, just copy and send to the bot
    - id of any telegram bot
